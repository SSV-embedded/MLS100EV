## 3.7 Attaching the Device to a Machine

Select a machine whose condition you want to record. We recommend something with rotating components like a washing machine, a fan, or a heat pump.

Attach the MLS/100EV with the provided double-sided tape to the machine.

> :information_source: **IMPORTANT!**
>
> Do not place the double-sided tape over the nameplate of the MLS/100EV.

> :warning: **ATTENTION!**
>
> **The MLS/100EV is for indoor use only!**
> 
> **Make sure that the workstation and the USB cable are positioned in such a way that they are secured against falling and no one can trip over them.**

# 4. OPERATION

## 4.1 Data Acquisition

When everything is configured and in place, you can start the data acquisition. To do this, draw a wire from the **trim node** to the **CSV node** like shown in figure 11 and click the `Deploy` button.

Record the data over a reasonable period of time. If you are monitoring a washing machine, for example, it would make sense to record the entire program.

To stop the data acquisition, select the wire between the **trim node** and the **CSV node**, press the `Delete` key and then click the `Deploy` button.

## 4.2 Data Analysis

To analyze the recorded machine data, we recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). This requires a Google account.

You will also need the **[analyze.ipynb](analyze.ipynb)** Python notebook, which you can find in the same repository as this document.

Log in to Colab, click in the **Open notebook** window on **Upload** and upload `analyze.ipynb`.

![Colab start window](https://ssv-embedded.de/bilder/github/colab_new.png)

*Figure 13: Colab "Open notebook" window*

![Colab analyze notebook](https://ssv-embedded.de/bilder/github/colab_analyze_notebook.png)

*Figure 14: Analyze Python notebook*

Click the **file icon** on the left to open the file explorer. Make a right-click in the file explorer below the **sample_data** entry, click **Upload** and upload your CSV file, e.g. `mls100ev_data.csv`.

![Upload the CSV file to Colab](https://ssv-embedded.de/bilder/github/colab_upload.png)

*Figure 15: Upload the CSV file to Colab*

Now you can execute the Python scripts in the notebook.

You can do this for each code cell in turn by clicking the **play button** to the left of the code cell and waiting each time until a **small green tick** appears next to the play button. Then click the play button for the next code cell and so on.

> :bulb: **TIP!**
>
> You can execute all code cells at once by clicking on **Runtime** in the menu bar and then clicking **Run all**. You can also use the shortcut `Ctrl` + `F9`.

![Run all code cells](https://ssv-embedded.de/bilder/github/colab_run_all.png)

*Figure 16: Run all code cells*

> :information_source: **Please note:**
>
> If the filename of your CSV file is not `mls100ev_data.csv`, you must edit the filename in the Python code!  

Below the code cells, you will now see a diagram of your recorded machine data.

# 5. FIRMWARE UPDATE

In the **[MLS/100EV GitHub repository](https://github.com/SSV-embedded/MLS100EV)** you can download firmware files (`*.bin`) that support different Mikroe click boardâ„¢ sensor modules for various use cases.

For the following description we will use the [`mls_blue_led_1.0.0.bin`](mls_blue_led_1.0.0.bin).

> :information_source: **Please note:**
>
> The ex-factory firmware file of the MLS/100EV is called [`mls_imu_1.0.0.bin`](mls_imu_1.0.0.bin).

## 5.1 Installing the Apache Newt Manager

To load a new firmware into the MLS/100EV, the command line tool **Newt Manager** from Apache is needed. Here you can **[download Newt Manager for Windows](https://dlcdn.apache.org/mynewt/apache-mynewt-1.13.0/apache-mynewt-newtmgr-bin-windows-1.13.0.tgz)**.

The downloaded archive contains an executable file called `newtmgr.exe`. Place it in a directory of your choice. 

### 5.1.1 Adding a Serial Connection

Open a command line interface, change to the directory with the `newtmgr.exe` and enter following command:

```
.\newtmgr conn add serial type=serial connstring="dev=COM4,baud=115200"
```

This setup will be stored at `C:\users\your_user_name\.newtmgr.cp.json`. This command therefore only needs to be executed once, unless the COM port of the MLS/100EV changes.

> :information_source: **Please note:**
>
> The used COM port (COM4) in this command is only an example! You must enter the COM port connected to the MLS/100EV. The [chapter 3.4](#34-connecting-the-mls100ev-to-the-workstation) describes how to find the correct COM port.

## 5.2 Opening the MLS/100EV

> :warning: **ATTENTION!**
>
> **To avoid damage through electrostatic discharge, discharge yourself electrostatically before working with the device, e.g. by touching a metal radiator, and stay grounded while working with the device.**

To start the **device firmware update (DFU) mode**, the housing must be unscrewed. You can use the screwdriver supplied for this purpose.

> :warning: **ATTENTION!**
>
> **Be careful when lifting the lid and make sure that you do not tear the antenna cable off the board or the lid! Place the parts in front of you like shown in the following figure.**

![Open MLS/100EV in DFU mode](https://ssv-embedded.de/bilder/github/mls100ev_open_update_mode.jpg)

*Figure 18: Open MLS/100EV in DFU mode*

## 5.3 Uploading New Firmware

> :information_source: **Please note:**
>
> Before starting the upload, make sure to disable the Node-RED flow or terminate Node-RED. Otherwise, the COM port is blocked and cannot be used to transfer the firmware file.

Connect the MLS/100EV to the workstation if it is not already connected.

Now push and hold the **BE button**, push and release the **RST button** and then release the BE button. The status LED lights up permantly red to indicate the DFU mode.

To transfer the firmware file, open a command line and enter the following command:

```
.\newtmgr -c serial image upload .\mls_blue_led_1.0.0.bin
```
> :information_source: **Please note:**
>
> In this example the firmware file is placed in the same directory as the `newtmgr.exe`. If this is not the case, you must enter the correct path to the storage location of the firmware file.

The file transfer may take a while.

After the successful upload, enter the following command or simply push the **RST button**, to exit the DFU mode:

```
.\newtmgr -c serial reset
```

The status LED starts flashing blue.

> :information_source: **Please note:**
>
> If the LED does not start flashing blue after the reset, simply repeat the reset.

To restore the MLS/100EV to the factory settings, simply repeat the steps from chapters 5.2 and 5.3 with the firmware file `mls_imu_1.0.0.bin`.
